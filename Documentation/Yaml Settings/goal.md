# Stardew Valley Archipelago - Goals

## Goal

The goal you choose is your completion condition for your slot. If playing alone, it does not matter much, as you can play and stop whenever you feel like it.

But when playing in a multiworld, you are generally making a commitment to "win" the multiworld, which means everyone reaches their goal.

In many cases, some server settings are related to the goal. For example, many multiworlds automatically release all remaining locations in a slot when that slot reaches its goal.

Fulfill the goal = Win!

In-game, you can read Grandpa's letter on his shrine to get reminded of what your goal is for this playthrough. The letter can only be read once.

## Goal Traits

- *Short*: This goal is very short. Can be used in sync games. Can be disappointing if you expect something similar to the vanilla game.
- *Long*: This goal is very long. It will probably take a few tens of hours, and should only be used in async games that are expected to take a while. You should only play this goal if you are very experienced in both the vanilla game and the randomizer.
- *Adaptable*: This goal's exact victory conditions will adapt to one or multiple other settings in your slot.
- *Focused*: This goal focuses on a single game mechanic, and excluding the potential for randomized items to be found elsewhere (depending on what you randomized), you will not be required to explore multiple game mechanics to finish the slot. *Focused* goals are generally less interesting, so are often used in themed games or challenge runs.
- *Coopable*: This goal relies on server status, and therefore several players can progress the same slot together to complete it.

## Goals

### Community Center

#### This is the main goal of Stardew Valley Archipelago. The randomizer is balanced around this goal, and it is the recommended goal for most players.

Restore the community center, by completing every bundle in every room. External bundles, like for example the missing bundle or the raccoon requests still exist in the world, but are not considered part of the goal.

- This goal can be **Short** and it can be **Long**. This will be mostly decided by the setting [Bundle Price](./bundle_price.md)
- This goal is partially *Adaptable*. Settings like [Bundle Randomization](./bundle_randomization.md) and [Bundle Price](./bundle_price.md) will change the content of the bundles and therefore have a significant impact on the goal. Settings like [Exclude Ginger Island](./exclude_ginger_island.md) will have a slight impact, by allowing or banning certain items from appearing in bundles.
- This goal is **not** *Focused*. You will be doing a bit of everything to fulfill bundles.
- This goal is **not** *Coopable*. To win, a save file must exist with a fully locally completed Community Center

### Grandpa's Evaluation

#### Obtain 4 candles during [Grandpa's Evaluation](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Grandpa).

In Archipelago, you do not need to wait for year 2 to get evaluated. Grandpa evaluates you every single morning, so your slot will goal as soon as it qualifies.
The mod provides a built-in tracker for evaluation points, shown above Grandpa's Shrine.

- This goal is **not** *Adaptable*. There are no settings that will customize this goal. The setting ~~[Profit Margin](./profit_margin.md)~~ probably has the strongest impact on the difficulty of the goal.
- This goal is **not** *Focused*. There are many things to do to obtain grandpa points and you can decide which ones to work on.
- This goal is **not** *Coopable*. A single farm must have a score sufficient to win the goal.

### Bottom of the Mines

#### Reach Floor 120 in the Pelican Town Mines

It is recommended to shuffle elevators, tools and skill levels to synergize with this goal.

- This goal is *Short*. It can be finished in a very reasonable time, and a skilled player can progress much beyond logic itself and goal even earlier.
- This goal is **not** *Adaptable*. There are no settings that will customize this goal, although randomizing elevators is an extremely important decision.
- This goal is *Focused*. You will be doing mostly mining and combat.
- This goal is **not** *Coopable*. A single player must reach Floor 120 only once.

### Cryptic Note

#### Complete the Quest 'Cryptic Note', which requires reaching Floor 100 of the Skull Cavern.

This goal requires to find the `Magnifying Glass`, the `Skull Key`, and some way to access `The Desert`. Then you must find the correct secret note, and lastly you must perform a deep Skull Cavern Dive. This requires a certain level of proficiency from the player, as an inexperienced player might be unable to complete the quest no matter how much stuff they unlock.

- This goal is **not** *Adaptable*. There are no settings that will customize this goal. Using the mod [Skull Cavern Elevator](../Supported%20Mods.md) can trivialize this goal.
- This goal is *Focused*. You will be doing mostly mining and combat.
- This goal is **not** *Coopable*. A single player must complete the quest.

### Master Angler

#### Catch Every Fish

You must catch every fish available in the world. It is recommended to use ~~[Fishsanity](./fishsanity.md)~~ with this goal, so that catching individual fish provides rewards, instead of being all pointless until the very last one.

- This goal is *Adaptable*. If ~~[Fishsanity](./fishsanity.md)~~ is enabled, the Goal becomes to catch every fish that has been chosen as a Fishsanity location, for example catching all easy fish.
- This goal is *Focused*. You will be doing mostly fishing.
- This goal is *Coopable*. If ~~[Fishsanity](./fishsanity.md)~~ is enabled, the goal is to send every Fishsanity location, not to actually catch the fish. Several players can coop a slot to send each a subset of the fish. If Fishsanity is diabled, the goal reverts to the vanilla definition which is **not** *Coopable*.

### Complete Collection

#### Complete the museum collection

You must complete the museum collection by donating all 95 minerals and artifacts. It is recommended to use ~~[Museumsanity](./museumsanity.md)~~ with this goal, so that donations or milestones contribute to your progress during the playthrough.

- This goal is **not** *Adaptable*. While the goal is closely related to ~~[Museumsanity](./museumsanity.md)~~, there are no museumsanity settings that reduce the size of the museum. They only change which donations will give an item.
- This goal is *Focused*. You will be doing mostly mining, finding artifact spots, opening geodes.
- This goal is **not** *Coopable*. One player must donate all 95 items in their local save file for the goal to be fulfilled.

### Full House

#### Get Married and have 2 children

You must find a husband or wife, get married, upgrade your house twice, and have two children. The children do not necessarily need to come from your current partner, they just need to exist at the same time as said partner.
This goal pairs well with ~~[Friendsanity](./friendsanity.md)~~, as without it, your goal will be mostly unrelated to your slot's progression.

- This goal is **not** *Adaptable*. The task remains the same regardless of settings.
- This goal is *Focused*. You will work mostly on friendship points with a single villager.
- This goal is **not** *Coopable*. One player must have a full house to fulfill the goal.



### Greatest Walnut Hunter

#### Find 130 Golden Walnuts

You must obtain a total of 130 walnuts over the course of your entire game. If using ~~[Walnutsanity](./walnutsanity.md)~~, the walnuts that you *receive* are the ones that are counted, not the locations. Walnuts that you spend are still counted for the goal.

In vanilla, there are 130 walnuts total. But in Archipelago, due to some technical limitations, you can obtain extra walnuts as part of an anti-softlock mechanic. This means that this goal will generally be easier than the vanilla version of it, and a knowledgeable player can make it even easier by grinding the correct things.

If this goal is picked, but [Exclude Ginger Island](./exclude_ginger_island.md) is enabled, your Ginger Island setting will get force-disabled, as the goal is impossible without Ginger Island.

- This goal is **not** *Adaptable*. The task remains the same regardless of settings.
- This goal is **not** *Focused*. If you are using ~~[Walnutsanity](./walnutsanity.md)~~, this goal is essentially a Macguffin Hunt where the goal is to receive several specific items, and you cannot focus on them specifically.
- This goal is **not** *Coopable*. One player must have received all 130 walnuts to complete the goal



### Protector of the Valley

#### Complete all the Monster Eradication Goals

You must complete all the Monster Slayer goals visible on the board at the Adventurer's guild. This goal pairs well with ~~[Monstersanity](./monstersanity.md)~~.

- This goal is *Adaptable*. The monster eradication goals vary depending on if you [Exclude Ginger Island](./exclude_ginger_island.md), if you included the Qi Board ~~[Special Order Locations](./special_order_locations.md)~~ and your ~~[Monstersanity](./monstersanity.md)~~ setting. The goal is to complete all the enabled monstersanity checks.
- This goal is *Focused*. You will be mostly navigating the various mines and slaying monsters.
- This goal is *Coopable*. If using ~~[Monstersanity](./monstersanity.md)~~, the goal is to complete all the monstersanity checks, which can be done by several players.

### Full Shipment

#### Ship every item

You must ship every item in the collections shipping tab, or every [Shipsanity](./shipsanity.md) check in your slot, depending on if [Shipsanity](./shipsanity.md) is enabled.

Selling items to vendors does not count. Shipping through the Ginger Island shipping bin or a mini-shipping bin counts.

- This goal is *Adaptable*. If [Shipsanity](./shipsanity.md) is enabled, the goal is to complete your shipsanity checks. This means you can make the goal much easier or much harder than the vanilla version.
- This goal is **not** *Focused*. Unless using something specific, like [Shipsanity](./shipsanity.md): Fish, you can generally expect that shipping every item includes interacting with many game mechanics.
- This goal is *Coopable*. If using [Shipsanity](./shipsanity.md), the goal is to complete every shipsanity check, which can be done by several players.

### Gourmet Chef

#### Cook Every Recipe

You must cook every recipe available in the Kitchen. This goal pairs well with both ~~[Cooksanity](./cooksanity.md)~~ and ~~[Chefsanity](./chefsanity.md)~~

- This goal is *Adaptable*. If ~~[Cooksanity](./cooksanity.md)~~ is enabled, the goal is to complete your cooksanity checks. This means you can make the goal much easier by only enabling cooksanity for a subset of recipes.
- This goal is *Focused*. You will be mostly doing cooking.
- This goal is *Coopable*. If using ~~[Cooksanity](./cooksanity.md)~~, the goal is to complete every cooksanity check, which can be done by several players.


### Craft Master

#### Craft Every Item

You must craft every item available in the Crafting Menu. This goal pairs well with ~~[Craftsanity](./craftsanity.md)~~

- This goal is *Adaptable*. If ~~[Craftsanity](./craftsanity.md)~~ is enabled, the goal is to complete your craftsanity checks.
- This goal is *Focused*. You will be mostly doing crafting.
- This goal is *Coopable*. If using ~~[Craftsanity](./craftsanity.md)~~, the goal is to complete every craftsanity check, which can be done by several players.

### Legend

#### Earn 10 000 000g

You must earn a total of 10 000 000g. This does not include your ~~[Starting Gold](./starting_gold.md)~~, but it is strongly impacted by your ~~[Profit Margin](./profit_margin.md)~~.

- This goal is **not** *Adaptable*. The amount remains the same.
- This goal is *Focused*. You will be mostly grinding good sources of money to get to that milestone.
- This goal is **not** *Coopable*. Your total earnings are on your current farm only.

### Mystery of the Stardrops

#### Find Every Stardrop

You must find all 7 stardrops spread out across the multiworld. If shuffled, you must **receive** the stardrop, and if some are kept vanilla, they must be obtained locally.

The stardrops are:
- At the Stardew Valley Fair. Is shuffled with ~~[Festival Locations](./festival_locations.md)~~
- On floor 100 in the mines. Is always shuffled.
- From the spouse or roommate upon reaching 12.5 hearts. Is shuffled if ~~[Friendsanity](./friendsanity.md)~~ is enabled to any degree.
- Sold by Krobus in the Sewers. Is always shuffled.
- Obtained from Old Master Cannoli in the secret woods. Is always shuffled. [Note for 7.x.x, this stardrop will be shuffled as part of ~~[Secretsanity](./secretsanity.md)~~]
- Received after catching every fish. Is shuffled with ~~[Fishsanity](./fishsanity.md)~~.
- Received after completing the Museum. Is always shuffled.
<br><br>

- This goal is **not** *Adaptable*. The amount remains the same.
- This goal is **not** *Focused*. The stardrops, shuffled or not, will require navigating many different tasks. This goal is essentially a Macguffin Hunt where the goal is to receive several specific items, and you cannot focus on them specifically.
- This goal is **not** *Coopable*. The energy bar must reach 508 on a single save file to trigger the goal.

### Allsanity

#### Complete every location check in your slot

You must complete every single one of your location checks to win, no exceptions. This goal cannot release after goal, as by definition, when it goals there is nothing left to release.

- This goal is *Adaptable*. Every setting you turn on adds more things to do to goal. Its duration will be highly variable
- This goal is **not** *Focused*. You literally need to do everything.
- This goal is *Coopable*. The condition for victory is based on the server state for locations, so multiple players can coop a slot. This goal is also severely helped by other players doing `!collect` on the slot.
- This goal is *Long*. While the duration is variable, and can technically be made medium or short, in the vast majority of cases, this goal will be a very long one due to having so many requirements and needing pretty much all your progression items.

### Perfection

#### You must achieve [Perfection](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Perfection) in your save file.

You must attain 100% perfection in your save file. This is entirely based on the vanilla definition of perfection. So even if some tasks are made shorter for their checks, for example ~~[Monstersanity](./monstersanity.md)~~: Very Short Goals, you will still need to complete the original goals to obtain perfection.

In many cases, if shuffled, the received items are what counts, for example hearts. The tasks are not what is counted. But in cases where there are no items (ex: ~~[Cooksanity](./cooksanity.md)~~), then the tasks are counted instead.

- This goal is **not** *Adaptable*. The requirements are always the same.
- This goal is **not** *Focused*. You pretty much need to do everything.
- This goal is **not** *Coopable*. The perfection tracker is almost entirely based on the local save state, so a single player must do everything.
- This goal is *Long*. This is arguably the longest goal, and will take tens of hours to complete.

### Mad Hatter

#### This setting is not released yet, and is only present in the 7.x.x development branch.

Complete all your hatsanity locations. If hatsanity is disabled, will enable it on "Easy+Tailoring".

- This goal is *Adaptable*. You can change which hat areas are needed.
- This goal is **not** *focused*. You will have to interact with many areas of the game to obtain every hat needed.
- This goal is *Coopable*. If using ~~[Hatsanity](./hatsanity.md)~~, the goal is to complete every hatsanity check, which can be done by several players.
- This goal is *Long*. While the duration is variable, and can technically be made medium or short, in the vast majority of cases, this goal will be a very long one due to having so many requirements and needing to obtain different hats.
