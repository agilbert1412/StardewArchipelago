# Stardew Valley Archipelago - Shipsanity

## Shipsanity

The Shipsanity option allows you to add locations for shipping certain items in the game. 

It adapts with the [Full Shipment Goal](./goal.md#full-shipment), allowing for focused games.

### None

There will be no locations for shipping any items. 

### Crops

Every crop and forage must be shipped.

### Fish

Every fish must be shipped.

### Full Shipment

Everything that appears in the "Items Shipped" [Collections Tab](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Collections) must be shipped.

### Full Shipment With Fish

Everything that appears in the "Items Shipped" [Collections Tab](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Collections), and every fish, must be shipped.

### Everything

Everything that can be placed into the Shipping Bin must be shipped.

This includes difficult or tedious items, such as Void Ghost Pendant, Tea Set, Far Away Stone, Butterfly Powder, and more.

This is not recommended for new or inexperienced players, and must be enabled with caution when combined with large mods like Archaeology or Stardew Valley Expanded.

### Crops and Fish

#### This setting is not released yet, and is only present in the 7.x.x development branch.

This setting is a combination of Shipsanity: Crops and Shipsanity: Fish, which allows for a simple middle-ground between Crops, Fish and Full Shipment.
