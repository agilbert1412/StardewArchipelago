# Stardew Valley Archipelago Yaml Settings

## Introduction

This document serves as a table of content for advanced documentation of every yaml setting available in Stardew Valley Archipelago.
You can access the [Options Page](https://archipelago.gg/games/Stardew%20Valley/player-options) or the [Advanced Options Page](https://archipelago.gg/games/Stardew%20Valley/weighted-options) to generate a yaml, or use the [Archipelago Launcher](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases) to generate a template to edit manually.
Options page are convenient, but not perfect. The space for descriptions is limited. The following pages give more detailed information about every possible setting.

This document is a work in progress. Nodes that are ~~struck through~~ do not exist yet. We accept contributions!

## General Settings

These settings decide what your playthrough will be. They do not directly add or remove shuffled locations or items, but instead indirectly decide what your playthrough will be.

- [Goal](./goal.md)
- [Farm Type](./farm_type.md)
- [Bundle Randomization](./bundle_randomization.md)
- [Bundle Price](./bundle_price.md)
- [Entrance Randomization](./entrance_randomization.md)
- [Exclude Ginger Island](./exclude_ginger_island.md)

## Major Unlocks

These settings are critical customization of items and locations. They are the biggest deciders of progression style, and how much of the core mechanics of the game will start out locked and be randomized.

## Extra Shuffling

These settings will shuffle an extra game mechanic, that is not critical to the playthrough but can help fit a specific theme, or add replayability to something that is otherwise always the same.
They generally focus on one very specific mechanic, and you decide whether to shuffle it or not.
