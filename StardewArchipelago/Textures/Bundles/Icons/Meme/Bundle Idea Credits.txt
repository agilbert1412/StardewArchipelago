This is the name of the person who brought up the idea first. Many of the ideas were slightly reworked by Kaito Kid during implementation, so they don't always perfectly match the original suggestion.
Sometimes, the final bundle is a merge of two submissions. In this case, both names will appear
I did not keep track of everyone who has seen or heard the prototype of a bundle, and provided feedback that ended up improving it. Sorry!
When it says 'X with the help of Y', it generally means X got the idea of making a bundle themed around Y, but then asked Y to design the bundle itself.
